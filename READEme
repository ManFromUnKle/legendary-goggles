1. for run this configuration  correctly you have to put  the correct path to your file rc3 in the file called pop to have the pop-up effect

2. put  the correct path in the rc file to load the image for the background

3. put the offpop file in /home/user/.conky 

4  to have the 'bottom' on the screen you have to correct also the path in the launcher to your pop file.

5 finally you can put the launcher in the screen and use to start/stop conky..

ask for any questions!!
